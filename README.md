# Pok√©mon resistance chart

Based on an original idea by [ConfusedFlareon on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/z6ibw0/oc_my_type_chart_now_with_resistances).

I originally needed a more printer friendly version at home for my daughter, so did a cut-up of the original image and printed at home, but we lost both the paper and my hacked image, so now I just do it as a crappy Javascript-page.

### How to use

Clone the repo and open the file index.htm in your browser.

It's all plain Javascript so it's ready to run.
